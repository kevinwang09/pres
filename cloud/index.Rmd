# Down the rabbit hole we go.

.pull-left[
+ Jean asked me to organise a lecture on Shiny. After testing various ideas, I ended up with three apps

  - Weather visualisation
  
  - Cats and dogs
  
  - COVID-19
  
1. Limitations of Shiny (computational)

2. Google BigQuery

**Apologies, this talk is more complains than being educational.**

# Cats and dogs

+ The app loads a pre-trained Keras model which can recognise common objects (particularly, cats and dogs) from a given picture.

+ The app keeps crashing and restarting. 

```
tensorflow/core/framework/allocator.cc:101] Allocation of 8589934592 exceeds 10% of system memory.
```

+ When I replaced the first model (VGG19, 550MB) by a similar model (ResNet50, 98MB), the app works.

+ While I am not sure how Keras models are used in connection with `R` and `shiny`, this behaviour suggests: 

  - There is an internal memory limit imposed by `shiny` onto TensorFlow/Keras, which is not imposed by RMarkdown during compilation
  - IStrangely, increasing the memory of the (virtual) machine didn't seem to help with the error

+ **Lesson: Don't make your Shiny app crazily computational heavy**

# COVID-19 data from JHU

+ Data are available as CSV files here: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19, e.g. 

| Province/State               | Country/Region | Lat      | Long     | 4/12/20 | 4/13/20 | 4/14/20 | 4/15/20 |
|------------------------------|----------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Australian Capital Territory | Australia      | -35.4735 | 149.0124 | 103     | 102     | 103     | 103     |
| New South Wales              | Australia      | -33.8688 | 151.2093 | 2857    | 2863    | 2870    | 2886    |

+ But I have processed data in this format before, so to make this more interesting, I tried out BigQuery.

# BigQuery and COVID-19

+ Google hosts a commercial database, BigQuery, and you can query the JHU COVID-19 data using SQL codes

```
SELECT country_region, confirmed
FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_jhu_csse.summary`
WHERE country_region IN ('Italy', 'Spain') AND date = '2020-04-02'
```

+ While `R` has the `DBI` and `bigrquery` packages to make queries to BigQuery, making this query in `R` will fail, because there is no existing method for parsing "GEOGRAPHY" SQL variable into R. 

+ So I had to upidate the package myself: https://github.com/kevinwang09/bigrquery/tree/geography. 

+ **Lesson: API packages are great, until they are not longer maintained**

# COVID-19 confirmed cases per capita visualisation

This seemingly easy task is not so easy if you rely purely on `R` code: 

+ Connection to multiple datasets and join the data are not always possible
+ You might need to manually process some of the geography variables, which can be cumbersome. See my [blog post](https://kevinwang09.github.io/post/joining-data-across-bigquery-data/) about this. 

+ My preferred way is to use Data Studio, but
  - It doesn't resolve the issue of JHU changing their data format every 2 weeks
  - Its plotting grammar is terrible compare to `ggplot2`
